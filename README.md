# covid_lineage_comparison

Tool for extracting differential SNPs between two SARS-CoV19 lineages or sublineages. Uses [Lapis](https://lapis.cov-spectrum.org/openapi/#/) data of SNPs present in at least 90% of the GISAID samples of the specific lineages (threashold can be modified in the code).

# Next steps
- [ ] Available as Jupyter Notebook, planning to create a .py script soon
- [ ] Create consensus from GISAID data
